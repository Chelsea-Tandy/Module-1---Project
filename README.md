It allows HR staff to add and remove employees from the employee list. It also has a calendar that shows who is in attendance, who is not there and who is on leave. It also allows payrolls to be calculated automatically and show digitally.its main purpose is for HR staff to have easy access to all employee detail and everything else. 

# Table of Contents
# Technologies Used
Vue.js 3. main.js uses createApp() from Vue 3. The project is structured using Vue Single File Components (.vue files). App.vue uses <script setup>, part of the Composition API introduced in Vue 3. Vue Router. Imported as router in main.js and used via <RouterView /> in App.vue. Enables single-page app routing/navigation. Pinia (or Vuex). A store is imported and used in main.js and App.vue (useMainStore()). If it's Pinia, it would be the modern state management tool; if it's Vuex, then the classic one. (Can confirm with store.js file. Bootstrap 5. main.js imports Bootstrap CSS and JS bundles: js. Copy. Edit. import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'. import 'bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js'. Tailwind CSS (Possible). Based on utility class names in App.vue, e.g., flex, h-screen, dark:bg-black, this suggests Tailwind CSS is also being used. Confirmable by checking tailwind.config.js. Service Worker / PWA Support. The import ./registerServiceWorker suggests Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality is set up. Custom Components. Components like <AppHeader />, <AppSidebar />, and <AppFooter /> indicate a modular layout with reusable Vue components.
